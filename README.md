# Skincare blog

Approach taken:
Thanks for dropping by my repository.
Here's a simple skincare blog (inspired by blogspot) where users are able to send in their daily logs of their skin journey and be able to share this to their friends. 

The objective of this platform is to shed light on the concept of beauty itself and normalize the idea of being "imperfect is perfect"- that no matter which skin journey you're at, it's an ongoing process and we are all in this together.
